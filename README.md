# odj - Open DJ Deck

This project documents an entirely open source DJ deck similar in functionality to the Pioneer XDJ units.

While the cost of electonic components has significantly gone down over the years, these items have seen no similar decrease in price, and only minimal increase in functionality for the high pricepoint.
This project seeks to rectify that fact by providing all information to assemble one yourself, with the use of:
- 3D printed components wherever possible, using parts designed with parameterization, allowing customization
- Commonly available and affordable off-the-shelf hardware components where necessary, with multiple options provided to account for regional sourcing differences
- Custom PCB design availble for sending to local manufacturers and again able to be edited for customization
- PCB design chosen based on the use of affordable and readily available components
- Open source firmware written to run the device also a part of this repository

This project is an ongoing and currently only early days so please bear with me as I slowly make progress with everythin that needs doing.
It's also a reasonably large undertaking so if you have advice, suggestions, or ideas, I am very much open and welcome any feedback or criticism. I want this to end up with a high quality product so if I'm making a poor decision anywhere please let me know.
